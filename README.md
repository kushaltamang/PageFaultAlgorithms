A page fault is a type of exception raised by computer hardware when a running program accesses a memory page that is not currently mapped by the memory management unit into the virtual address space of a process.

This is a program that implements the FIFO, Optimal, MFU, and LRU page-replacement algorithms. Given a page-reference string, where page numbers range from 0 to 9, it applies the page-reference string to each algorithm, and output the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm.
